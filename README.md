User Base Login with JWT
Project Overview
This project implements a CRUD user-based login system using JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. It involves both frontend and backend development, where the backend handles user authentication and CRUD operations, and the frontend provides the user interface.

Backend Setup and Running Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Node.js (version 14 or higher)
PostgreSQL
Docker (optional, for containerization)
.env file with database connection details
2. Setting Up the Backend
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd backend
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up the PostgreSQL database:

Create a database (e.g., user_db).
Set up your .env file with the following details:
makefile
Copy code
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=user_db
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Run the database migrations (if applicable) or set up the required tables. You should have a table called users with columns like id, name, email, and password.

To run the backend server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Frontend Setup and Running Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Node.js (version 14 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Ensure the backend is running on http://localhost:3000
2. Setting Up the Frontend
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd frontend
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
To run the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
POST /signup: Registers a new user.
POST /login: Logs in a user and returns a JWT token.
GET /users: Retrieves all users (protected route).
GET /users/
: Retrieves a specific user by ID (protected route).
PUT /users/
: Updates user details (protected route).
DELETE /users/
: Deletes a user (protected route).
Folder Structure
Backend
controllers/: Contains the logic for user authentication and CRUD operations.
routes/: Defines API routes.
middlewares/: Contains middleware for authentication (JWT verification).
config/: Contains database connection settings.
.env: Environment variables for database and JWT secret.
Frontend
src/components/: Contains UI components like Login, Register, UserProfile, and UserList.
src/redux/: Manages authentication state using Redux.
App.js: Main component for handling routes and rendering pages.
index.js: Entry point for the React app, wrapped with Redux Provider.
Running Backend and Frontend Separately
Running the Backend
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000.

Running the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
Backend
Deploy to AWS EC2: Host your backend on AWS EC2, configure environment variables for production, and ensure the backend is reachable.
Dockerize: Optionally, you can use Docker to containerize both the backend and PostgreSQL database.
Frontend
Deploy to Netlify/Vercel: Host the frontend using services like Netlify or Vercel. Ensure you update the API base URL to point to the production backend.
Troubleshooting
CORS Issues: If you encounter CORS issues, ensure that the backend allows requests from the frontendâ€™s URL. Example in Express:

javascript
Copy code
const cors = require("cors");
app.use(cors());
JWT Expiry: JWT tokens expire after a certain time. If the token expires, users will need to log in again.

Conclusion
This project provides a full-stack CRUD application with JWT authentication. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, while the frontend is built with React and Redux. The application uses JWT for secure user login and CRUD operations.
